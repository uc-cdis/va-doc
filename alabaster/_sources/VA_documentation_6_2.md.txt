# Getting Started
## **Login Page**
Users will login with their VA PIV credentials.  Start by visiting the login page (https://va.data-commons.org/login). Sign in with your organizational account and password. After successfully logging in, your username will appear in the upper right-hand corner of the page. 
Click this link for more information about using the <a href="https://www.oit.va.gov/resources/remote-access/cag/windows/index.cfm?#piv" target="blank">PIV login</a>.

Once logged in, the user will see there are several options in the upper right hand corner of the screen. In the blue bar at the top of the page, there is a link to VA Data Commons Documentation (the page you are currently reading), Email Support, your username and a log out button.  Below these options, there are tabs for the Workspace, the Apps, and the Profile pages.
Clicking on the VA Data Commons logo in the upper left hand corner of the screen will return you to the home page of the data commons.

### **VA Data Commons Documentation**
The button for VA Data Commons Documentation takes you to this page.

### **Email Support**
If you need help, the Email Support button allows you to send a message to our help desk at support@datacommons.io 

## **Profile Page**
The Profile page contains two sections: API keys and Project access.

[Note - Insert image of profile page here]: #

### **API key(s)**
To download large amounts of data, an API key will be required as a part of the <a href="https://gen3.org/resources/user/gen3-client/" target="blank">gen3-client</a> . To create a key on your local machine, click Create API key, which will activate a pop-up window. 

[Note - Insert image of create API Key here]: #

Click Download json to save the credential file to your local machine. After completion, a new entry will appear in the API key(s) section of the Profile page. It will display the API key key_id and the expiration date (one month after the key creation). The user should delete the key after it has expired and create a new key. If for any reason a user feels that their API key has been compromised, the key should be deleted before subsequently creating a new one.

### **Project Access**
This section of the Profile page lists the projects and the methods of access for the data within in the Gen3 VA Data Commons system. If you do not see access to a specific study, check that you have been granted access. 

# Data Access and Analysis
## **Workspace**
Workspaces are secure data analysis environments in the cloud that can access data from one or more data resources. By default, Workspaces include Jupyter notebooks and JupyterLab, Python and RStudio, but can be configured to host virtually any application, including analysis workflows, data processing pipelines, or data visualization apps. 

New to Jupyter? Learn more about the popular tool for data scientists on <a href="https://jupyter.org/" target="blank">Jupyter.org</a> (disclaimer: CTDS is not responsible for the content).

[Note - Insert image of workspace page here]: #

There are five workspace options available. The options include two versions of Jupyter Notebook Bio Python/R which employ the classic Jupyter Notebook in two different sizes (one large, 4.0 CPU, 8192 Mi memory, and one small, 0.5 CPU, 512 Mi memory), two versions of Jupyter Notebook Bio Python/R (Lab Edition) which opens JupyterLab, the latest interactive development environment for notebooks, code and data also with the option of two sizes (one large and one small), and one workspace option with R Studio. Click "Launch" to spin up a copy of that VM.  Launching may take several minutes depending on the size and complexity of the workspace.  

Once the VM is ready, the initial screen for the workspace will appear. After launching, the home folders are displayed, one of which is the user's persistent drive ("pd"). For scripts and output that need to be saved when the workspace is terminated, store those files in the pd/ directory. Only files saved in the /pd directory will remain available after termination of a workspace session. 

Start a new notebook by clicking “New” in the top right corner and choose between Python 3 or R Studio as the base programmatic language. 
Code blocks are entered in cells, which can be executed individually or all at once. Code documentation and comments can also be entered in cells, and the cell type can be set to support Markdown.

Results, including plots, tables, and graphics, can be generated in the workspace and downloaded as files. Only files saved in the /pd directory will remain available after termination of a workspace session. 

<mark>Do not forget to terminate your workspace once your work is finished to be mindful of the cost-intensive computational effort. Note, that Workspaces automatically shut down after 90 minutes of idle time.</mark>

## **Apps**
The Apps page displays the option of two apps, OHDSI Atlas and Gen3 GWAS. Using these Apps, a user may perform a genomic analysis on available data from projects that they have access to.

### **OHDSI Atlas**
ATLAS is an open source software application developed as a part of <a href="https://www.ohdsi.org/" target="blank" >OHDSI</a> community intended to provide a unified interface to patient level data and analytics. 

ATLAS currently includes functionality for searching and navigating the vocabulary within the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM). In addition to the search and navigation capabilities, It also provides features to curate and export custom sets concept identifiers for use in cohort definitions.
ATLAS is an open science analytics platform that can be used to perform analyses across one or more observational databases which have been standardized to the OMOP Common Data Model V5 and can facilitate exchange of analysis designs with any other organizations across the OHDSI community who have adopted the same open science community standards and tools. Use the ATLAS app to create cohorts that you can analyze in the Gen3 GWAS app. 

The ATLAS user guide can be found <a href="https://www.ohdsi.org/web/wiki/doku.php?id=documentation:software:atlas" target="blank" >here</a>. (disclaimer: CTDS is not responsible for the content).

### **Gen3 GWAS**
Use this app to perform a high throughput GWAS on MVP data using the University of Washington Genesis pipeline.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) help scientists identify genes associated with a particular disease (or another trait). This method studies the entire set of DNA (the genome) of a large group of people, searching for small variations, called single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs (pronounced “snips”).

Here, we offer two types of GWAS analysis- 

**Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for quantitative phenotype.** Here, GWAS evaluates statistical association between genetic variation and a continuous phenotype. A phenotype, also called a trait, can be any measured or observed property of an individual. 

**Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for a case-control study.** Here, the genotypes of roughly equal number of diseased (“cases”) and healthy (“controls”) people are compared to determine which genetic variants are associated with the disease. Cases are encoded as ‘1’ while controls are encoded as ‘0’ and a binary model is used.

Each of these Gen3 GWAS options are available through the GWAS App, and consist of 5 steps. Between the steps, click the Next or Previous box in the lower corners of the screen to navigate between them.


### **GWAS for quantitative phenotype**

**Step 1**

Select the cohort you would like to use for GWAS from the choices in the box on the screen. You may choose one of the Test cohorts, Diabetes Demo or T1D-cases. (**Note: Need a description of these studies**) Click Next.

**Step 2**

Select harmonized variables for phenotypes and covariates from the table of variables.  The selected variables will be used for both the covariates and the phenotype. Click Next.

**Step 3**

Select which variable is your phenotype from the variables that were selected in Step 2. Click Next.

**Step 4**

Set workflow parameters and adjust the number of population principal components,  minor allele frequency cutoff, imputation score. Remove unwanted covariates and choose the ancestry population on which the study should be performed. Click Next.


**Step 5**

Review the metadata selections, name the study, and submit GWAS job for analysis by clicking the Submit button.

**Check Submission Status**

Once your GWAS analysis is submitted, click the arrow in the **Submitted Job Statuses** box to activate the drop down menu and see the status of your analysis.  This menu will display a history of your submitted jobs including the Run ID of your analysis, the start time, and the finish time when the run is completed. This menu will also display whether the analysis was a success or failed. Once completed, you may download the results of the GWAS analysis from this menu or delete the results.


### **GWAS for a case-control study**

**Step 1**

Select the cohort you would like to use to define your study population for GWAS from the choices in the box on the screen. You may choose one of the Test cohorts, Diabetes Demo or T1D-cases. (**Note: Need a description of these studies**) Click Next.

**Step 2**

Continue defining the study population by selecting the cohort to define your "control" population. Click next.

**Step 3**

Select harmonized variables for covariates from the table of variables.   Click Next.

**Step 4**

Review the covariate selection and based on % missing metrics return to Step 3 to adjust the covariates using the previous button. When covariates are properly selected, click Next.

**Step 5**

Set workflow parameters and adjust the number of population principal components,  minor allele frequency cutoff, imputation score. Click Next.

**Step 6**

Review the metadata selections, name the study, and submit GWAS job for analysis by clicking the Submit button.

**Check Submission Status**

Once your GWAS analysis is submitted, click the arrow in the **Submitted Job Statuses** box to activate the drop down menu and see the status of your analysis.  This menu will display a history of your submitted jobs including the Run ID of your analysis, the start time, and the finish time when the run is completed. This menu will also display whether the analysis was a success or failed. Once completed, you may download the results of the GWAS analysis from this menu or delete the results.
